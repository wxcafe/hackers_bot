## Hackers Bot

Posts hackers gifs on twitter and mastodon.
You need to register a twitter app and a mastodon app for it to work correctly,
and fill the variables in the hackers_gif.py file. Install dependencies via
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

The gifs are possibly subject to copyright from whoever produced the movie, but
`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Thanks to @lindseybieda (https://twitter.com/lindseybieda) for the code needed
to generate the gifs (https://github.com/LindseyB/videos-to-gif)
